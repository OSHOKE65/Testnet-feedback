## ✅ Objective  
To actively participate in Succinct’s testnet by:
- Stress-testing node operations or APIs (once public)
- Documenting edge cases, errors, and inconsistencies
- Providing readable, actionable feedback to the team

---

## ⚙️ Testing Style  
- Black-box mindset: Simulate end-user scenarios to reveal breakpoints  
- Risk-based prioritization: Focus on areas with high protocol fragility  
- Feedback Loop: Write logs, summarize issues, suggest improvements

## 🧪 Simulated Testing (Pre-Access)

While awaiting invite, I’ve been simulating testnet behavior using probabilistic models and early assumptions based on zk proof patterns.

### Example Simulation:  
```plaintext
Model: Risk-adjusted reward testing for staking/farming behavior  
Rounds: 300  
Strategy: Mini-martingale  
Outcome: 9.4% ROI | 0% Risk of Ruin | 4-loss max streak  
Tools Used: Python, matplotlib
